President Obama used to say that “if you wanted to see something really screwed up, give it to Joe Biden to do.” In fact, he tried to keep Joe from running, “you don’t have to do this Joe”, and then wouldn’t endorse him until long after the Primaries ended. “Joe is lost!”.

The S&P downgrade is a direct result of @BarackObama's increased reckless budget spending and Obama Care. He owns this.
Obama Care is already having a devastating impact on our economy.
America's debt officially became 100% of our GDP on @BarackObama's 50th birthday---coincidence?
Republicans gave Obama a free pass to the White House -- they just don't get it.
Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.

While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit, our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President.
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal.
Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!

If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency.
Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks--First and foremost CUT,CAP and BALANCE.
Congress is back.TIME TO CUT, CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem.The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained.
Once again Obama is going to lose on another prospective nomination. Chuck Hagel will not be named Sec. of Defense--&amp, probably shouldn't be.
Obama wants taxes to go up so he can take credit for lowering them next year.
“Donald Trump on Fiscal Cliff and Obama” http://t.co/5SY7E3On via @Livetradingnews
President Obama spoke for me and every American in his remarks in #Newtown Connecticut.
We are way over the fiscal cliff.  And with Obama Care being fully implemented in less than 14 months, it may be too late.
I am happy to hear that Pres.Obama is considering giving Anna Wintour @voguemagazine an ambassadorship.  She is a winner &amp, really smart!
Obama is laughing at Karl Rove &amp, all the losers who spent hundreds of millions of dollars and didn’t win one race, including the big one!
Obama is totally “tweaking” the Republicans because he doesn’t respect them—they’ve got to change their ways.
As I said on @foxandfriends this a.m., you have to give Obama credit—he won! ...
My kids never negatively discussed my criticism of President Obama with me or anyone...it's not in their nature!
The dying NY Daily News put out a false report about my kids not wanting me to criticize Obama...totally false!
Pres. Obama’s steady support of @Israel throughout this crisis helped stop the war.  He did a good job.
Obama met with Chinese Premier Wen yesterday http://t.co/LF0hjd7Q  and talked trade. The Chinese are robbing us blind--be tough!
“We are fully supportive of @Israel's right to defend itself.” -- @BarackObama--Very good, I like it.
Does anyone really believe that President Obama found out about Petraeus immediately after the election?
President Obama, we need to protect our closest ally, Israel. The situation in the Middle East is at a tipping point.
Obama’s own top donor is now laying employees off and lowering hours in anticipation of Obama Care http://t.co/OviEuDqW  The new reality.
Scary – in the past 90 days, Obama has set over 6,125 regulatory burdens http://t.co/FbyJMJtV Terrible for the economy.
Businesses have already started massive layoffs and reducing employees’ hours due to Obama Care.  Reality is setting in.
Why do so many people say I hate President Obama—I don’t hate the President at all. I just disagree with his policies!
9 million fewer people voted for Obama this election than last &amp, yet the Republicans lost—do you think they might be doing something wrong!
The election was a major setback for economy. All young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate Obama's policies into their investments.
Polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for Obama on his win- isn't that ridiculous?
China's submarines will soon be carrying nukes http://t.co/oX6JYnqE  They will be sent to patrol our coasts, Obama won't do anything.
China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection.  They have never had it so good.  Will own America soon.
At the end of the day, Obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes. This was a winnable race.  GOP needs to do better!
With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can.  Can get a great deal.
No surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating Obama's win.  They love a weak America that they can rip off.
Obama's administration is now openly admitting it expects US credit downgraded again http://t.co/v7RwPT0P Thanks for letting us know now
Russian leaders are publicly celebrating Obama's reelection.  They can't wait to see how flexible Obama will be now.
The stock market and US dollar are both plunging today.  Welcome to @BarackObama’s second term.
Millions without electricity across NY &amp, NJ. The media has covered for Obama’s massive failure. Can you imagine if this was another Pres?
House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.
Obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the American public. He can't.
Watch Obama refuse to call Benghazi a terrorist attack on 9.12 http://t.co/hy6O6r8F What took @CBS so long to release this footage?
If you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from Obama supporters, make sure you report it immediately.

Very dangerous pattern developing across country by Obama supporters.  Detroit poll watcher was threatened with gun http://t.co/XfJiqT6G

Why is Obama playing basketball today? That is why our country is in trouble!
Benghazi is bigger than Watergate.  Don’t let Obama get away with allowing Americans to die.  Kick him out of office tomorrow.
Voting for @GovGaryJohnson is voting for Obama--don't waste your vote!
"Obama just stated ""It's always good to ignore Donald Trump."" I state he is right, especially when the truth is against him."

Don't believe Chrysler (if Obama wins)--see how fast @Jeep production will be moved to China--and I'll be watching!
Obama’s policies have led to food stamp rolls growing 75X faster than job production http://t.co/VMJy9XjJ  We can't afford 4 more years.
Remember when you vote, Obamacare is a disaster!
We don’t want to have a recount in any of the battleground states. Obama will steal it. Make sure all your friends and family vote.
Obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years. 4 more years??
Undecideds in OH,PA and WI will make the difference. All should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under Obama.
Considering Obama hasn’t proposed anything concrete, if he wins he won’t have a mandate.  Another 4 years of legislative stalemate.
Members from Obama's own job council are endorsing @MittRomney http://t.co/mYT6zbmi  Not surprising
Concerns over the national debt are stopping businesses from hiring and expanding http://t.co/nuzGMIkt Obama's policies are unsustainable
Castro, Chavez and Ahmadinejad are all anxiously awaiting our election results.  They are praying Obama wins.
Obama promised 5.2% unemployment by October 2012.  His promises are worthless!
Obama has destroyed the middle class.  In ’09, median household income was $55,198.  Now it is $50,678.  Four more years?
Obama our Welfare &amp, Food Stamp President, is praising himself for expanding welfare http://t.co/cAOUnJT0  He doesn't believe in work.
How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction.
Interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding.
With long gas lines &amp, total disarray from storm, the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama.
It was announced this morning that unemployment rose--this can't be good for Obama.
How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?  And he continues to lie to the public!
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say!
If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused.
My video response to President Obama's lack of transparency. http://t.co/oK9SpIc7
I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public.
President Obama missed the deadline!
Obama is a terrible negotiator. He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will!
Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China?  He is ruining American industry.
It's 10 AM: Two hours to go for Obama to easily pick up millions for charity!
Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President--give me a break.
A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to.  The onus is on Obama to first release his records.
President Obama, if it is important to you, I will substantially increase the $5M offer!
President Obama, please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow. It is so easy and could do so much good!
A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama’s lack of transparency. I don't blame them.
There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice, once he releases all of his records.
In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi.
Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ. Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater.
How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week? Another scandal ignored by the liberal media. http://t.co/eXJyiGeB
An amazing article by Kevin Gabriel-  http://t.co/yt7LPuME A must read by friends and foes of President Obama. End date is tomorrow at noon.
Part 1 of my @jimmyfallon interview discussing my $5M offer to Obama, #TRUMP Tower atrium, my tweets &amp, 57th st. crane http://t.co/AvLO9Inf
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go.
Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?
Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years?
Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?
@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charity
Let’s be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday.
How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?
Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes.
My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St. crane, damage from the storm and extending my $5M offer to Obama http://t.co/ebUofUW0
These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.
The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline.
Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more!
Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.
Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.
Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it.
Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.
Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama. Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible!
I always said Obama is lucky for himself but unlucky for the country. The storm could be very good for him as he (cont) http://t.co/BbBpnYfY
Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.
"Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was ""probably"" born in the US--the word ""probably"" is a disaster for Obama."
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.
"A lot changed when David Letterman said "" he was probably born in this country""--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama."
I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request, I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement.

If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say?
If my offer is refused, every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $5M to charity all because he is hiding something!
Barack Obama has everything to gain. Why would anyone ever deny $5M to charity?
"""Donald Trump Defends His ""Big"" Obama Bombshell: 'It's Not a Publicity Stunt'"" http://t.co/KY2wgyz4 via @eonline"
I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.
Where's the transparency? Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright.
Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
By the way, where is @Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah.
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?
"Be careful of an Obama ""bomb"" to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do."
The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney. He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding. VOTE!

A clip from last night's @Late_Show where I detail my charitable offer to Obama and Dave describes his terrible grades http://t.co/02ABDshA
@LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors--Obama should choose that as his $5M charity.
Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience, I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain....
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
Letterman @Late_Show was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires...

Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when $5M is going to charity.

I just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth. A puppet of Obama?
Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama.  As Sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity.  What does Obama have to lose?”
My offer to Obama is about transparency. In 2008, American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record.

70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago http://t.co/pVppYf8l  At least someone has done well under Obama.
The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.
Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate
.@MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.
Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy http://t.co/6rzfGjMM  Pretty generous!
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden.
"""This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility."" Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal."
Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.
Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!

"Obama said ""not optimal"" to Ambassador &amp, embassy killings--bad word usage for a Harvard graduate."
I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week--stay tuned!
It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?
Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right, the economy has not been fixed under Obama.I always said Bill was an honest man.
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. Their internals must be horrendous.
@TorresTerrell @BarackObama  Thanks!
@womenzbinder Check the records, dummy--I was never a Bush II fan--he is why we have Obama!
Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future. Does he even care?

Under his administration, oil and gas production on public land is down over 10% http://t.co/1ZISkkn9  Obama did not tell truth last night.
If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records--all of them.
Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary
"""Trump Was Right: 'Obama's America' Tops 2012 Documentaries""  http://t.co/VAisvQlh  via @Newsmax_Media"
Obama was beaten but not knocked out.  He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance...
If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally &amp, aesthetically.
Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!
Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!
Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
"Obama just said @MittRomney was ""a very successful investor""--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility."
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
.@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records &amp, transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.
Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast &amp, Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President.
Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.
.@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected.
Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over.
Gov. Gary Johnson pulling votes from @MittRomney--Don't waste your vote. Obama must go!
If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night, Obama is finished!

"""Romney, Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation"" http://t.co/K6xUXSwa via @ABC"

Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again.
"""What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy."" --@PaulRyanVP"
Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.
ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.
Why does Barack Obama's ring have an arabic inscription? http://t.co/upa00265 Who is this guy?

DELUSIONAL--Obama actually thought that he won the debate http://t.co/nkPWyb1m What is he thinking?
47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media?
I just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure.
Remember, Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful!
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks...
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.  He is desperate.
With these record high gas prices, what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate?
Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices?
California gas prices going thru the roof, others to follow. An election-losing event for Obama.
Obama projected a 2012 budget deficit of $557B.  It is actually double that at $1.1T http://t.co/QR8vZIcP  We can't afford four more years.

Obama now wants to give another $450M to the Muslim Brotherhood. Money we don't have going to people that hate us. Moronic.
Obama deserves much less credit for the killing of Bin Laden. The praise goes to our brave military and intelligence officers.
Only 36 days until the election. @MittRomney needs to stay on offense. Make Obama's terrible record the issue. #TimeToGetTough
"In debate, @MittRomney should ask Obama why autobiography states ""born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia."""
Obama lied to the public about the Al Qaeda attack on our consulate in Libya. He should be held accountable.

ObamaCare is a failure. Costs are rising much faster under Obama than other Presidents.
Now Obama's campaign is guaranteeing 12 million new jobs during a 2nd term http://t.co/uTnOkmdd  More like $12T in new debt if he wins.
If only the morons @AP were as concerned with Obama's inconsistent statements on the Embassy attacks as they are (cont) http://t.co/kkJz0Xd2

Home values have sunk a record 15% under Obama.
Scary--Obama's budget deficits are so out of control that he has to borrow 40 cents on every dollar he spends.
With Obama and Bernanke destroying the value of the dollar, gold and real estate should continue to rise in value.
The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11. Time for Obama to come clean.
With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy, Obama should be down by 12 points--and he's not.
Weekly jobless claims are up once again. The economy cannot recover with Obama in office.
Why did @MittRomney give his tax returns without demanding that Obama release his college records &amp, applications in return?

QE3, a political favor for Obama, will cause record inflation on food and fuel.  This hits low income families the hardest. Big mistake.
"""Trump: Obama is 'Unlucky President'"" http://t.co/rFzb4VqU via @Newsmax_Media"
Obama should play golf with Republicans &amp, opponents rather than his small group of friends. That way maybe the terrible gridlock would end.
Obama killed over 100k jobs by not approving Keystone XL pipeline and Canada is now selling the oil to China--very dumb!
Liberal press won't look into why Obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with Romney's private comments.
None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster. 20% real unemployment and $6T in deficit spending.
It's Tuesday. How many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores Obama's record?
With 49 days until the election, @MittRomney needs to stay on offense. He should not be apologizing. Deflect onto Obama's record.
Now a small country like Sudan tells Obama he can't send any more Marines http://t.co/kMstNUBH We are a laughing stock.
It's Monday, how many more excuses will Obama make today about the economy?
While Obama is denying it, he did receive intelligence about the attacks 3 days before http://t.co/u78hfrJt Too busy campaigning?
Gas prices have doubled under Obama. Over $5/gallon now in California. We must start drilling from our own resources to become independent.
Obama is our unlucky President. Everything he touches turns into a mess. Some people just don't have it!
"Via @digitaljournal: ""Donald Trump tweets Obama is 'an incompetent President'"" http://t.co/KuTnUOqB"
After being ripped off for years, Obama finally figured out that China is taking advantage of us. He's finally listening to me.
First Obama says Egypt is not an ally. Then he promises to keep handing over aid  http://t.co/AQVEdKZn Incompetent and unqualified.
No surprise--Obama's Deputy Campaign Manager tweeted link from Chinese propaganda outlet http://t.co/JMgUoRMF Did she also write it?
RT @MittRomney: For nearly 4 years, Barack Obama has refused to crack down on China's cheating &amp, American workers have paid the price.
Why doesn't Obama let our marines who are guarding the embassies in Egypt have live ammunition? They need it fast.
It's amazing--@hardball_chris has completely lost all connections to reality. He is a complete shill for Obama.

Obama's convention bounce is gone. @MittRomney has retaken the lead in the latest @RasmussenPoll  http://t.co/yOw3U3ja
The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney.
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally. They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak.
"Wake Up America!  See article: ""Israeli Science: Obama Birth Certificate is a Fake"" http://t.co/f7esUdSz"
If Obama was smart, he would cancel the Muslim Brotherhood's WH visit later this month. He won't.
Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had.
We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy. Great going Obama--Israel is in trouble.
Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP. If Obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013.
Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President. Obama=Carter.
I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out. The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11. Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing?
Obama will go down as the worst President in history on many topics but especially foreign policy.
"""It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic (cont) http://t.co/NNyJdQGy"

OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous!

Many Red-State Democrats sticking with Obama on deficit spending on the ObamaCare monstrosity will be defeated in 2014.

ObamaCare is imploding. It is a disaster and 2017 will be the worst year yet, by far! Republicans will come together and save the day.
We are making great progress with healthcare. ObamaCare is imploding and will only get worse. Republicans coming together to get job done!
I feel sure that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster!
"For eight years Russia ""ran over"" President Obama, got stronger and stronger, picked-off Crimea and added missiles. Weak! @foxandfriends"
Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster - is imploding fast!
122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision!
How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!
I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!
Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.
"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!"
The first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs......
The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo.

massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight - be careful!
Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases......

President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing, slightly larger version!
“It turns out to be true now, that the Department of Justice and the FBI, under President Obama, rigged the investigation for Hillary and really turned the screws on Trump, and now it looks like in a corrupt &amp, illegal way. The facts are out now. Whole Hoax exposed. @JesseBWatters
For all of the sympathizers out there of Brett McGurk remember, he was the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH &amp,  sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker.
When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn’t, I thought I should. Interesting relationship-but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had. Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of U.S.
Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015. Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!
“I’m proud of the President today to hear that he is declaring victory in Syria.” Senator Rand Paul.  “I couldn’t agree more with the presidents decision. By definition, this is the opposite of an Obama decision. Senator Mike Lee
The DEDUCTIBLE which comes with ObamaCare is so high that it is practically not even useable! Hurts families badly. We have a chance, working with the Democrats, to deliver great HealthCare! A confirming Supreme Court Decision will lead to GREAT HealthCare results for Americans!
The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years. However, if you don’t separate, FAR more people will come. Smugglers use the kids!
Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!
As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done!
The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they can’t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?
....which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obama’s - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer’s liability if he made a mistake, not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!
....children from parents, as did Bush etc., because that is the policy and law. I tried to keep them together but the problem is, when you do that, vast numbers of additional people storm the Border. So with Obama seperation is fine, but with Trump it’s not. Fake 60 Minutes!
.@60Minutes did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the Obama Administration. In fact a picture of children in jails was used by other Fake Media to show how bad (cruel) we are, but it was in 2014 during O years. Obama separated....
Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have “Obama judges,” and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an “independent judiciary,” but if it is why......

There is No Collusion! The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore, the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!

So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didn’t he do something about it? Why didn’t he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax, that’s why, and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!
The Rigged Witch Hunt, headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for Obama W.H.), seems intent on damaging the Republican Party’s chances in the November Election. This Democrat excuse for losing the ‘16 Election never ends!

Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours. Actually, we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama. Fake News is working overtime!
Democrats, fix the laws. Don’t RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama, but we need strength and security at the Border! Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders, No Crime!
Drudge Report  “OBAMA KEPT THEM IN CAGES, WRAPPED THEM IN FOIL” We do a much better job while at the same time maintaining a MUCH stronger Border! Mainstream Fake Media hates this story.
We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!

Sorry, I’ve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.
The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!
Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages. They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country...Bipartisan Bill!

Why didn’t President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing.
This whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven’t been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats, and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE &amp, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST!
Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks. I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine. Dems do nothing....

I ask Senator Chuck Schumer, why didn’t President Obama &amp, the Democrats do something about Trade with China, including Theft of Intellectual Property etc.? They did NOTHING! With that being said, Chuck &amp, I have long agreed on this issue! Fair Trade, plus, with China will happen!
I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!
....At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption...
Wow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI “SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT.” Andrew McCarthy says, “There’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.” If so, this is bigger than Watergate!

Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake &amp, Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA &amp, Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!

As ridiculous as it sounds, the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place. Mexico &amp, Canada have tough immigration laws, whereas ours are an Obama joke. ACT CONGRESS
Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign &amp, Russia. (2)  The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.
.....They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along, but didn’t have the “smarts.” Obama and Clinton tried, but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!
I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......

Rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50%, which is higher than Obama, and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are “somewhat low.” They know they are lying when they say it. Turn off the show - FAKE NEWS!
Federal Judge in Maryland has just ruled that “President Trump has the right to end DACA.” President Obama had 8 years to fix this problem, and didn’t. I am waiting for the Dems, they are running for the hills!
Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.
Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn’t the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!
“Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump” @FoxNews  Of course not, because there is none, and never was. This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace...and Obama did nothing about Russia!
Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!

Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!
Obama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election. So why didn’t he do something about Russian meddling?
Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn’t I a great candidate?
Finally, Liddle’ Adam Schiff, the leakin’ monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam!
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!
Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House &amp, Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!
